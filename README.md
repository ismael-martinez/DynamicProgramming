## Dynamic Programming ##
This Dynamic Programming Project is loosely based off my potential thesis topic regarding Optimization in Fog Computing. Uses both an exact solution as well as a parametric approximation for extension of higher number of steps.

The main script is `FogSimulateData.py`.
```
python FogSimulateData.py
-d <number of IoT devices>
-f <number of fog devices>
-s <random seed>
```
